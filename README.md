# Chase_add_offers
A javascript file to paste into console and all offers on chase credit card automatically 

Navigate to your chase credit card offers page.
Inspect element, go to console (or press cmd+option+J on mac)
Copy paste the contents of main.js into the console, press enter
type CHASE_INTERVAL.START() and press enter
You can change the values of the interval to speed it up but I wouldn't recommend going below 800ms, can break it if site lags.
